# C (Processes and Signals)

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **processes and signals** implemented in **C programming**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Operating Systems** course during my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.dieei.unict.it/corsi/l-8-inf) at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it).

## üåç Context

This repository covers various aspects of process management and signal handling in the Unix/Linux environment using C programming. <br>
The exercises focus on process creation, inter-process communication via signals, signal handling mechanisms, and practical applications of signals in system programming.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Process Management**: Understand process creation, termination, and communication mechanisms in Unix/Linux systems. 
- **Signal Handling**: Gain proficiency in handling signals such as SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL, and implementing custom signal handlers.
- **System Programming Skills**: Enhance practical programming skills through exercises involving processes and signals.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Basic Process Creation**: Exercises on learning how to create and manage processes using fork() and exec() functions.
- **Signal Handling Basics**: Exercises on implementing basic signal handlers to manage SIGINT and SIGTERM signals.
- **Working with Signals**: Exercises on using standard signals to control process behavior.
